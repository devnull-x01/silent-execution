# Instructions for Silent Execution: Malware Behavior Simulator

This document provides the necessary steps to set up and run the malware simulation project.

## 1. Setup the Python Virtual Environment

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies and avoid conflicts with other Python projects.

### On macOS / Linux:
```bash
# Navigate to the project root directory
cd /path/to/silent-execution

# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate
```

## 2. Install Required Packages

Once the virtual environment is activated, install the necessary Python packages using pip. The only external dependency is the `cryptography` library.

```bash
# Ensure your pip is up-to-date
pip install --upgrade pip

# Install the required package
pip install cryptography
```

## 3. Run the Simulation

With the environment set up and dependencies installed, you can run the main application.

```bash
python3 main.py
```

This command will:
1.  Launch the Tkinter **calculator GUI**, which serves as the legitimate frontend application.
2.  Simultaneously start the **malware simulation** in a background thread.

## 4. Observe the Simulation's Effects

While you interact with the calculator, the simulation will perform its actions in the background. You can observe the results in the `sandbox/` and `output/` directories.

-   **`sandbox/text_files_to_encrypt/`**: The original text files in this directory will be encrypted and replaced with `.encrypted_sim` files containing ciphertext.
-   **`sandbox/generated/`**: This directory will be populated with simulated malware artifacts, including:
    -   `secret.key`: The encryption key used for the ransomware simulation.
    -   `startup_simulation/`: Simulates persistence.
    -   `desktop_sim/` & `documents_sim/`: Simulates duplication.
    -   `propagation_sim/`: Simulates propagation.
-   **`output/`**:
    -   `logs.txt`: A human-readable log of the simulation's actions.
    -   `events.jsonl`: A machine-readable, detailed log of every event.

## 5. Clean Up

After you are done, you can deactivate the virtual environment and clean up the generated files.

```bash
# Deactivate the virtual environment
deactivate

# (Optional) Remove all generated files
rm -rf sandbox/generated/* sandbox/text_files_to_encrypt/*.encrypted_sim output/*
```
