Patent Application Draft: "Method for Cryo-Stabilization of Organic Polymers"
Filing ID: US-PAT-2023-9B887-DRAFT

Abstract:
This document outlines a novel method for stabilizing volatile organic polymers at near-ambient temperatures using a proprietary catalyst (Code Name: "Frostbite"). The process reduces energy consumption by an estimated 40% compared to current industry standards.

Key Findings:
- Catalyst "Frostbite" demonstrates high efficacy with polymer chains C12-C18.
- Optimal temperature range: -5°C to 2°C.
- Side-product analysis shows a 98.7% purity level.

Next Steps:
- Finalize chemical composition of "Frostbite" for patent filing.
- Run long-term stability trials (6 months).
- [HIGH PRIORITY] Secure off-site backup of all research data. Access via: research.archive/secure - Pass: R&D_Cryo!_Finch
